Hardware Overview
-----------------

The default configuration is expecting a box with 6 LED-Strips each having 17
LEDs.  We used an Arduino/Genuino, a 5V 10A power supply and the [LED-strips
with product id 2432 by Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2432).

The white LED-Strip linked is a RGB-Strip with 3 white LEDs instead of colored
LEDs. This means you can built a light box with colored light without adapting
the source code or any of the wiring diagrams.

__Wiring overview__ _The number of LED-Strips is limited by the Amperage
supplied by the Power Supply and the number of PINs of the Arduino. The length
of a LED-Strip is limited by the resistance of the strip itself. For strips
longer than 1 meter add an additional `GND` and `5V` every meter. The Serial
API and HTTP API are described below._

---

__Note:__ The strip numbers on the back of the hardware device do not match the
strip indices in software. See [Strip reordering](#strip-reordering).

---

The software was designed to drive strips with identical length. Strips of
different length, however, should work, too. If you are deploying strips of
different lengths, set the configuration to the length of the longest strip.

__Wiring for a single LED Strip:__ _A digital PIN is sufficient; no PWM is needed.
You can also use the Analog Input PINs for `CI` and `DI`. Do not use PIN 0 and
PIN 1, they interfere with the Serial connection and do not work._


# Software

---

__Note__ that you cannot upload new sketches to the arduino while the light-box
HTTP-server is running. Stop the server, upload the sketch and restart the
server.

---


Configuring the Software for your Hardware Setup
------------------------------------------------

First __set the number of LEDs and LED-strips__ by changing the constants in
`light-box/arduino/arduino.ino`:

```c
	#define NUM_LEDS   17 // Number of LEDs in a strip
	#define NUM_STRIPS 2  // Number of strips
```

If you are using the HTTP API, you have to additionally set the options in the
`config/config` file:

```js
	light_box_number_of_strips: 2,
	light_box_strip_length: 17,
```

You may also have to set the serial port in the configuration file:

```js
	light_box_serial_port_path: "COM1",
```

The light-box HTTP server prints a list of all connected serial devices and
port names on start up to `STDOUT`.

__PINs and Strip Reordering__


Deploying the Software
--------------------

To run the source code, upload the sketch in `light-box/arduino/` to your
arduino and wire everything like shown below.

If you want to use the HTTP-API, connect a machine using a standard A-B
USB-cable (this is the one you use to upload your sketches) and run the server
on it:

```
	node --es_staging light-box/server/server.js
```

Testing your Setup using the HTTP API
-------------------------------------

To test your setup visit URLs of the structure
`http://localhost:8082/strip/:strip-number/LED/:led-number/intensity/:intensity`,
where `:intensity` is an integer in the range of `[0, 0xFFFFFF]`. For example:
Set the 5th, 6th and 7th LED on the first strip to progressively brighter
values:

```
	curl http://localhost:8082/strip/0/LED/4/intensity/1
	curl http://localhost:8082/strip/0/LED/5/intensity/1000
	curl http://localhost:8082/strip/0/LED/6/intensity/2000
```
To change the state of a whole strip, use the format
`http://localhost:8082/strip/:strip-number/intensity/:intensity`.

This is equivalent to setting the first out-of-bounds LED-address, as a last
virtual LED changes the intensity of all physical LEDs in the strip. For a
strip with 30 LEDs, both calls below are equivalent:

```
	curl http://localhost:8082/strip/0/intensity/0xFF
	curl http://localhost:8082/strip/0/LED/30/intensity/0xFF
```

Note that, in contrast to best practices in REST-API design, the server
expects the HTTP-Method to be `GET`.

The Serial API
--------------

You can change the baud rate by altering the constant in
`light-box/arduino/arduino.ino` and reuploading your sketch:

```c
	#define BAUD_RATE 9600
```

The serial API expects 4 byte datagrams of the following form:

*****************************************
* 1st byte                     4th byte *
* +--------+--------------------------+ *
* | LED id |         brightness       | *
* +--------+--------------------------+ *
*****************************************

whereas LED id is 1 byte and brightness is 3 byte between `0` and `0xFFFFFF`.

If you are using RGB LED-Strips, use the following datagram:

*****************************************
* 1st byte                     4th byte *
* +--------+--------+--------+--------+ *
* | LED id |   R    |   G    |   B    | *
* +--------+--------+--------+--------+ *
*****************************************

whereas LED id is 1 byte and R, G, B is the brightness of the red, green, respectively
blue diode between `0` and `0xFF`.
